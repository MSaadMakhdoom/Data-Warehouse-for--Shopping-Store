## Implementation of MeshJoin algorithm optimizes semi-stream join operations in Data Warehousing.
 
### Implementation of MeshJoin algorithm optimizes semi-stream join operations in Data Warehousing.
### Multiple stream tuples and master data tuples are joined in a single iteration using a multi-valued hashmap.
### The algorithm populates a DW with the star schema and includes OLAP queries to test the star schema's functionality.
### MeshJoin algorithm effectively optimizes semi-stream join operations in DW.
### OLAP queries to answer some queries

## Steps to run the code
### use Eclipse 
### The java file contains an extra DDL function that creates tables, comment it if you only want to use the DDL SQL file.
### The two required jar files are included in the folder, make sure to include them in your project's 'Java Build Path'.
### To connect to your database, input your schema name, username, and password when prompted by the code.
### Make sure to update the "package SQL" on the top of the code to match your own project name
