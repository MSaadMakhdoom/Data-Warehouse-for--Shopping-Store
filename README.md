### Implementation of MeshJoin algorithm optimizes semi-stream join operations in Data Warehousing.
### Multiple stream tuples and master data tuples are joined in a single iteration using a multi-valued hashmap.
### The algorithm populates a DW with the star schema and includes OLAP queries to test the star schema's functionality.
### MeshJoin algorithm effectively optimizes semi-stream join operations in DW.
### OLAP queries to answer some queries
